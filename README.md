# Project mình không còn maintain nữa, Supabase cũng update api rồi, web sẽ vẫn còn nhưng nhiều operation sẽ không chạy được.

# The Booker

This is the source code of my final project for the web programming course in my second year of university. My teacher taught me how to make web pages with cshtml, following the mvc model,... But at first I missed a few lessons and ended up with some gaps in my knowledge. Too lazy to catch up and thinking that it was just a simple e-commerce website, I decided to use the technologies I already knew (from when I was in grade 12) to make my own website from scratch.

## Cái mình dùng
